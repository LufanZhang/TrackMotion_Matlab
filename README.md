# TrackMotion_Matlab
•	Used MATLAB to read the video and get a set of image frames from this video.
•	Matched two neighbor image frames using RANSAC algorithms and used Harris corner detector to accurately create the corner point.
•	Implemented  Lucas-Kanade optical flow method to track the objects’ motion.
